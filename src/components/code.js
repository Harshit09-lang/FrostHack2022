                      for everyone, regardless of the following:

                      We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon
                      participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any

                      Harassment includes offensive verbal
                      comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
                      disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion
                      or political views, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
                      stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable
                      consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
                      contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

                    <p>
                      Photography is encouraged, but other
                      participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed.
                      If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is
                      inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable
                      expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Participants asked to stop any
                      harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

                      As this is a hackathon, we like to
                      explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the
                      anti-harassment policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sponsors and partners are also subject
                      to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised
                      images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including
                      volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise
                      create a sexualised environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you are being harassed, notice that
                      someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
                      of hackathon staff immediately.

                    <p>
                      Hackathon staff will be happy to help
                      participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts,
                      or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of
                      the hackathon. We value your attendance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If a participant engages in harassing
                      behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This
                      includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if
                      applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

                    <p>
                      We expect participants to follow these
                      rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.</p><br />
